# HomelistGPT
homelist plugin mostly generated by ChatGPT

Pretty simple and the code probably looks crappy. I wanted to test the abilities of ChatGPT and asked it to help me with a plugin that allows players to save home coords and view them in an inventory GUI.
Some stuff was definitely messed up but it made the basics perfectly. Kind of refused to generate the code making a GUI when executing /home list and I noticed that is saves coords to config.yml without any distinction of which player they belong to so it missed on that mark too.

Try it out if you want or suggest more features to test! Enjoy.
